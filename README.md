The `primitive` package [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/primitive.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/haskell/primitive)
=======================

This package provides various primitive memory-related operations for Haskell.

See [`primitive` on Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/primitive) for more information.


## how to test and benchmark
currently the test and benchmark package suites can be invoked (as of cabal-install 2.4. or newer) via
`cabal v2-test test` and `cabal v2-bench bench` respectively. They are structured as separate packages
at this time for dependency management.
